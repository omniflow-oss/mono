# OmniflowCX Documentation Roadmap

## Current focus

- Keep VitePress docs aligned with the `./mono` CLI and Taskfile behavior.
- Document scaffolding and deletion workflows for apps, services, libs, and packages.
- Keep contract tooling and docs build requirements accurate.

## Near-term improvements

- Add service ownership and on-call rotation notes in `docs/handbook/`.
- Add ADRs for contract governance and port policy in `docs/adr/`.
- Document CI gating rules once the pipeline is wired.

## Maintenance rules

- Update docs in the same change as tooling updates.
- Prefer concise, task-focused instructions over long plans.
